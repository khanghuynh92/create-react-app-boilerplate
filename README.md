# React React App Boilerplate

## About

This is a starter boilerplate app I've put together using the following technologies:

* [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
* [React Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)
* [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux)
* [Redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk)
* [CSS-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
* [Bootstrap-sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass)
* [Reactstrap](https://github.com/reactstrap/reactstrap)

## Usage
**Step 1**. Make sure that you have Node.js v9 or newer and yarn installed on your development machine.
**Step 2**. Clone this repository

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/khanghuynh92/create-react-app-boilerplate.git MyApp
$ cd MyApp
$ yarn
```

**Step 3**. Compile and launch your app by running:
```shell
$ yarn start  # Compiles the app and start server with "hot reload"
```

Now the app should be running at [http://0.0.0.0:3000/](http://0.0.0.0:3000/)
